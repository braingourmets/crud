# CRUD demo

[![GitHub CI Status](https://github.com/braingourmets/crud/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/braingourmets/crud/actions)

This little Rails demo application shows CRUD forms for several configurations:

* model not namespaced, controller not namespaced
* model namespaced, controller not namespaced
* model not namespaced, controller namespaced
* model namespaced, controller namespaced

In all configurations, the model namespace should not be part of the URL
(which added additional hurdles).

This little application is a product by the
[Brain Gourmets](http://www.braingourmets.com/).
