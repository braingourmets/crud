# CRUD demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braingourmets/crud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braingourmets/crud)

This little Rails demo application shows CRUD forms for several configurations:

* model not namespaced, controller not namespaced
* model namespaced, controller not namespaced
* model not namespaced, controller namespaced
* model namespaced, controller namespaced

In all configurations, the model namespace should not be part of the URL
(which added additional hurdles).

This little application is a product by the
[Brain Gourmets](http://www.braingourmets.com/).
